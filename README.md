![Dental Clinic Management System](/path/to/your/logo.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to the frontend repository for the Dental Clinic Management System! This is a comprehensive web application built to streamline clinic operations, manage appointments, and enhance patient care. The app is developed using React, TypeScript, GraphQL, and AWS Amplify, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience for both clinic staff and patients.

## Features

- Appointment Management: Schedule, update, and track patient appointments efficiently.
- Patient Profiles: Maintain detailed patient records, including contact information and medical history.
- In-App Messaging: Facilitate real-time communication between clinic staff and patients for enhanced patient care.
- Staff Roster: Manage the clinic's staff and their roles effectively.
- Task Tracking: Assign and track tasks and errands for the staff members.
- Monthly Reports: Generate insightful reports to analyze clinic performance and trends.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/dental-clinic-management-frontend.git
cd dental-clinic-management-frontend
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up AWS Amplify:

AWS Amplify allows us to quickly configure and integrate our frontend with AWS services. To get started, make sure you have an AWS account and the AWS CLI installed. If you don't have the AWS CLI installed, you can download it from the AWS website and configure it using:

```bash
aws configure
```

This will prompt you to enter your AWS access key, secret key, default region, and default output format. Once configured, Amplify will automatically use these credentials to access your AWS services.

4. Initialize the Amplify project:

```bash
amplify init
```

Follow the prompts to set up the project. Choose an existing environment or create a new one, and select your preferred editor and language. Amplify will create a new backend environment to host the GraphQL API and other services.

5. Add the AWS Amplify dependencies:

```bash
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

6. Set up the Amplify GraphQL API:

```bash
amplify add api
```

Follow the prompts to set up the GraphQL API. You can choose to create a new API or use an existing one. Amplify will automatically generate the necessary GraphQL schema, resolvers, and types based on your data models.

7. Deploy the Amplify backend:

```bash
amplify push
```

This will deploy your backend resources to AWS, including the GraphQL API and any other services you added.

8. Run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
